Easily search across your data using keywords, asset names, or descriptions, and apply custom tags such as Sales, PII, or Orders for efficient data governance. Clearly define Data Owners and Stewards, and add detailed descriptions and calculations to maintain transparency and facilitate collaboration, enabling effective and compliant data management.
