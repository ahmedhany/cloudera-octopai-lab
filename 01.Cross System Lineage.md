### Cross System Lineage

1. Your first step is to **search for the report titled "Top Product Sales"** in the *"Reports, Analytics & Information Consumers"* section of this dashboard. This will kickstart your investigation.

2. Upon hovering on the **"Top Product Sales"** report, click the icon titled **“Cross System Lineage”** to view its immediate lineage. You'll observe that the report receives data from **four key tables**:  
   - `dbo.DwhDimCustomer`  
   - `dbo.DwhProductSubCategory`  
   - `dbo.DwhFactSales`  
   - `dbo.DwhDimProduct`

   These tables, in turn, are populated by **five ETL processes**:  
   - **DATASTAGE** (`LoadDwhCustomer`)  
   - **INFORMATICA** (`LOAD_FACT_SALES` and `LOAD_DW_DIM_PRODUCT`)  
   - **SSIS** (`Load DWH`)  
   - **Azure Data Factory** (`AzureAdventureWorksProduct`)
