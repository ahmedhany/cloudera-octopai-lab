# Octopai Hands-On-Labs
Welcome to Octopai Data Lineage Hands-On Workshop by Cloudera 
# Scenario
Imagine you're a data engineer at a fast-growing retail company. This morning, your CEO flagged an anomaly in the "Top Product Sales" report: the value for "Total Product Cost" appears incorrect, significantly deviating from expected benchmarks. As the go-to expert, you've been tasked to quickly identify and debug this discrepancy.

In this workshop, you'll leverage Octopai to trace how "Total Product Cost" is computed within your data pipeline. Your mission: pinpoint exactly where the calculation went astray, understand the transformations applied, and ensure data accuracy moving forward.
Let's dive in and solve this mystery step-by-step!
