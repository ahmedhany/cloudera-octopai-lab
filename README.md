# Octopai Hands-On-Labs
Welcome to Octopai Data Lineage Hands-On Workshop by Cloudera 
# üîç Introduction to Data Lineage & Octopai
Before we jump into the hands-on scenario, let‚Äôs take a moment to understand what Data Lineage is and how Octopai helps solve real-world data issues.

## üìå What is Data Lineage?
Data lineage is the ability to track the flow of data from its origin all the way to its final destination ‚Äî across ETL pipelines, databases, reports, and dashboards. It helps answer critical questions like:

- Where did this data come from?
- What transformations were applied?
- Why does this value look incorrect?

Lineage empowers data engineers and analysts to debug faster, audit changes, and trust their data.

## üöÄ What is Octopai?
Octopai is an automated data intelligence platform that visualizes cross-system data lineage across:

- ETL tools (like Informatica, SSIS, DataStage)
- Databases (e.g., SQL Server)
- Reporting tools (like Power BI)

With Octopai, you can instantly:
- See upstream and downstream lineage
- Search for any column or process across systems
- Understand data dependencies and transformations in seconds

# Scenario
Imagine you're a data engineer at a fast-growing retail company. This morning, your CEO flagged an anomaly in the "Top Product Sales" report: the value for "Total Product Cost" appears incorrect, significantly deviating from expected benchmarks. As the go-to expert, you've been tasked to quickly identify and debug this discrepancy.

In this workshop, you'll leverage Octopai to trace how "Total Product Cost" is computed within your data pipeline. Your mission: pinpoint exactly where the calculation went astray, understand the transformations applied, and ensure data accuracy moving forward.
Let's dive in and solve this mystery step-by-step!
# How to Start
Please check your login credentials with the organizer.

After logging into the Cross System Lineage Dashboard, you'll see an overview of ETLs, stored procedures, SQL files, database objects, and analytics services currently in use. The dashboard categorizes these elements clearly, providing immediate visibility into your system's complex data landscape.

Please follow the instruction files in the same order shown above.
